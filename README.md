# Tic-Tac-Toe

- Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a minimalist and clear user interface.
- It is a real time Tic-Tac-Toe game built using WebSocket server instead of typical HTTP server.
- Players can play online as well as offline with each other.
- When you choose to play online, the server connects you to some other player randomly on the other side of globe.
- Users can play until someone wins or the game ends in a tie.
- It also indicates which user's turn is this.
- Technologies used are React, 'ws' library for WebSocket and TypeScript. Frontend is deployed on vercel.com and backend is deployed on render.com.
- NOTE : The backend is hosted on a free instance of Render, which spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. This may cause a 40-50 seconds delay when restarting the server, so please expect some delay when playing online for the first time after a period of inactivity.
